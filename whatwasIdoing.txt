I introduced checkbox option to give user an indicator for the videos that he has watched already a kind of bookmark done successfully.

next task : Used Redux to make the logged in user information globally available without the need to actually refetch it from the server everytime. last file Modified : Navbar.jsx where i was checking the flooding of user reducer by printing the values , it worked fine for fresh refresh but as i change my code obviously the state is set to nothing again . so try to fix the hard reload problem .

PROBLEM : how to retain the user information even after hard reload .
